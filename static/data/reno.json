But in the grand scheme of things, how much better can you make something that should only have about four ingredients?\r\n\r\nThat’s the way we see it anyway.\r\n\r\nPeople who only want the best beer will always be looking for it.  We’d rather just sell good beer to people who believe what we believe.\r\n\r\nBattle Born personifies those beliefs.\r\n\r\nSo while everyone else tries to invent the next pumpkin nut brown ale, we figure we’d keep it simple and build a great brand.\r\n\r\nAfter all, it’s just beer.",

Tables and chairs were made from materials we uncovered during demolition. The taproom showcases the original truss ceilings, brick masonry and maple hardwood floors and blends it with a modern design. Our outdoor patio is dog friendly for well behaved, leashed good boys and good girls. A perfect place to sip a cocktail made with 10 Torr Spirits or 10 Torr Precision Crafted Beer.",

We only ask that they do what they do best and brew with passion and love. We will also be featuring an impressive selection of guest draft handles and bottle selection to help compliment our own beers.\r\n\r\nWith a small kitchen onsite, we will be creating a fresh and local menu for our customers with an emphasis on quality ingredients that pair superbly with our brews. We want to create a comfortable and relaxed atmosphere for our customers, so that they can enjoy the environment no matter what time of the day, nor what the occasion is.\r\n\r\nThe Brewer’s Cabinet will focus on spreading awareness of the local brewing community. We hope to feature local commercial breweries and their great beers, which we hope will lead to a series of collaborative projects in creating new beers. We want a strong local home brewing community, that is part of the brewery, with the invitation to come in and help design beers with our brew masters.

        "description": "We make beers for all palates. A lot of our beers have been lovingly referred to as so finely crafted that they seem to be made for a serious wine drinkers palate. A saying goes in wine making, \"it takes a lot of good beer to make good wine...\". The point being, we make complex, delicate, nuanced beers, not just the same typical west coast hop bombs or dark extremely high alcohol brews (though we make quality versions of those too). Our goal is to show the whole spectrum of beer, its history, and its evolution. To show beer its proper reverence, as not only \"The people's beverage\", but one that pairs as well with food as wine, and when it's skillfully crafted and not over hopped to hide the flaws in production, it does. The truth is, it takes more skill to make a delicate lager, than a double IPA. You would be hard pressed to find anyone more passionate and knowledgeable about beer than myself or my brewer Josh Watterson. We welcome you to come down to our weekly brewery tours, and discuss all things beer, food, wine, or whatever be the topic of the day!",

We came up with the concept in the late 80?s, about seven years after we met.\r\nWe’d been talking about opening a business together for years. We eventually narrowed the field down to the idea of an upscale, modern-version of the classic brewpub. Then in 1991 the idea became a goal. That goal was to create a unique place in Reno; a restaurant and brewery where the service was as good as the food and the beer was worth coming back for; a place where locals could meet friends after work, or treat their dates and clients to original and delicious dishes.",

        "description": "Buckbean Brewing Company — the first package brewery in Western Nevada and the second of three in the Silver State — began operations in a new 7,600-square-foot facility in Reno, NV in April 2008. Buckbean Brewing Company debuted with two styles of beer in 16 oz. cans, which has now grown to three, but also offers different styles on tap. The brewery houses a tasting room and offers guided tours free of charge.\r\n\r\nBuckbean Brewing Company is the vision of Reno native Douglas S. Booth and Veteran brewmaster Daniel B. Kahn. These two self described “beer junkies” joined up in 2004 to create a new kind of microbrew appealing to both male and female beer drinkers.",

We promote public awareness and appreciation for the award-winning quality and variety of beer produced in Indiana, advocate for favorable regulatory treatment from state and federal agencies, provide support to brewers throughout the state, and, along with the City of Indianapolis, co-own Tomlinson Tap Room, where you’ll find only Indiana beers all the time.\r\n\r\nSince Indiana’s oldest brewery, Broad Ripple Brewpub, opened its doors in 1990, the number of Indiana breweries has increased dramatically to nearly 100. Our brewers bring home medals from the most prestigious competitions in the United States, like the Brewers Association‘s Great American Beer Festival and the World Beer Cup.\r\n\r\nBrewers of Indiana Guild is the driving force behind the Drink Indiana Beer public awareness campaign which strives to support Indiana’s craft breweries in a variety of ways.",
